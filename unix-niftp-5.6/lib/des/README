The old code used a cruddy encryption algorithm.
As the data held at your site pertains to local and remote hosts,
it is both dangerous for your own local users, and for all other sites that
anyone on your site contacts.
It is thus HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that the des code is used instead.
As an intermediate step, "CRUDDY_CRYPT_COMPAT" can be defined, which allows
the old format encrypted files to be read, but writes DES.

If you don't have a system supplied library, get the PD one from
"info-server@cam.cl", comp.sources.unix

I have included the compiled libraries for some of the architectures I have
here. You can either install the relevant one in /usr/lib/libdes.a, or you can
tell Configure to load the relevant one by setting the des library to
something like ../lib/des/libdes-sun4.a

Only if that fails should you consider setting "CRUDDY_CRYPT_ONLY" !!
