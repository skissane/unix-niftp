.SH SYNOPSIS
.B x25d 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR X25d
listens for incoming calls and starts up a process based on
the action described in /etc/x25d.conf.
The process chosen is based on
.B protocol id
and (if appropriate)
.B YBTS.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
Each process description takes up one line of the configuration file
and consists of five fields:
.IP protid
the protocol id ("X.29" or "YB").
"X.29" matches "0x01<any><any><any>".
"YB" matches "0x7fffffff".
.IP YBTS
the service required (e.g. "ftp" or "ftp.mail").
This should be "-" for X.29.
.IP adaptor
The protocol adaptor (adapter) to be used - either "X.25" or "X.29".
.IP program
The program to be started to service the call.
This should be the full pathname of either a UNIX-NIFTP listener (for YB)
or a login handler (usually /etc/getty) for X.29.
.IP args
The arguments to the process,
space separated and starting with the process name (i.e. argv[0]).
.SH "variable substitution"

will be replaced by the appropriate string value.
Variable names and the values to be substituted are as follows:
.IP "host, calling_host or calling_name"
The full NRS name of the host making the call,
or the DTE if no name can be found.
.IP "short or calling_shortname"
As above, but shortened to fit a utmp host entry.
.IP "dte or calling_dte"
The DTE address of the host making the call.
.IP "ybts, called or called_ybts"
The service being requested, e.g. "ftp.mail".
.IP "calling_ybts or calling"
The calling hosts's YBTS.
.IP called_dte
The DTE address used to connect to you.
