newstoniftp 26/4/88

Newstoniftp provides a simple mechanism for sending off news batches to
neighbouring news sites. It takes a news batch as standard input and
queues it for transmission to one or more hosts. The hosts are given
(By UUCP name!) as arguments. Batches are spooled in the files
/usr/spool/niftp/news/<site>/n.<pid>, where <site> is the UUCP name
of the host to recieve the batch, and <pid> is an arbitrary number :-).

UUCP names are translated into proper addresses by, unfortunately, an
internal table which needs to be edited before compilation of newstoniftp.
Perhaps someday this will be done properly - using a config file. The
table looks something like this:

struct news_addr addr_trans[] = {
	"strath-cs",		"uk.ac.strath.cs",
	"ukc",			"uk.ac.ukc",
	"paisley",		"uk.ac.paisley.cs",
	"glasgow",		"uk.ac.gla.cs",
	"dcl-cs",		"uk.ac.lancs.comp",
	"turing",		"uk.ac.turing",
	"abacus",		"uk.ac.strath.abacus",
	"its63b",		"uk.ac.ed.its63b",
	0
};

The first field gives the UUCP name used by the news software and the second
translates this into the proper address.

For example, when batching news to ukc, /usr/lib/news/sendbatch will invoke
/usr/spool/news/outbatch/ukc.cmd, which will start the newstoniftp process
correctly:
	: use /bin/sh
	: Move news to ukc via niftp
	exec /usr/local/niftp/newstoniftp ukc
this will put the news batch in the file /usr/spool/niftp/news/ukc/n.<pid>
and execute the command:
	cpf -Nw /usr/spool/niftp/news/ukc/n.<pid> @uk.ac.ukc

Note that pathnames may vary from site to site.

Where newstoniftp is given more than one recipient site on the command line,
the spool files are created using hard links, so that only one actual copy of
the batch is stored.

qnews/unqnews 8/4/88

  Qnews and unqnews provide a simple queuing mechanism for incoming news
batches. Qnews, invoked by the appropriate listener, places each news
batch in a spool file. Unqnews picks up these spool files in chronological
order and invokes inews(1) to process them.

CONFIGURATION
  There are several options to be configured before building qnews and
unqnews. These are defined in config.h:

UNQNEWS		The pathname where unqnews can be found. This is usually
		/usr/lib/news/unqnews.

BATCHDIR	The directory for spooling news batches. Batches are placed
		filenames something like BATCHDIR/rnews.<serial number> and
		collected (later?) by unqnews.

ERRLOG		The absolute pathname of a file to be used for error
		logging by either qnews or unqnews. The file should be
		writable by the UID specified by NEWSUSER in the tailor
		file. Typically, ERRLOG will be "/usr/lib/news/qnews.errlog".

MAXLOAD		The maximum load average at which news processing will
		be done. If this is undefined, no account will be taken
		of the load average and news will be processed no matter
		how crippling this could turn out to be to your poor
		machine. If defined, the load average is examined before
		starting the processing of each batch by inews. The load
		average used is the one averaged over five minutes (the
		middle of the three as printed by uptime etc.).

PEAKTIME	If PEAKTIME is defined, no news processing will be done
		during peak hours (8 a.m. to 6 p.m.). Unqnews will exit
		whether it is started by qnews or cron.

DAEMON		If daemon is defined, qnews will NOT start up unqnews
		upon receiving a news batch. Unqnews can then be started
		by cron at the appropriate time (usually sometime during
		the night).

RWHO		If rwho is defined, unqnews will use the rwho daemon
		to find out the load average. If undefined, it will
		dig around in /dev/kmem looking at kernel variables.
		Only meaningful when MAXLOAD is defined.

INSTALLATION
  Usually the binaries for qnews and unqnews will reside in the news
home directory, "/usr/lib/news". If this is not the case, edit Makefile
and change NEWSDIR to be the directory you want to put them in.
  Type "make" and, if all goes according to plan, "make install".

INVOCATION
  Qnews is invoked either with a list of pathnames of niftp spool files,
or with the spool file open on the standard input:
/usr/lib/news/qnews <filename> ...

This is typically achieved by putting the following line in your
niftptailor file:
NEWSPROC   "/usr/lib/news/qnews %s"
