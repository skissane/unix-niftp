Mailer descriptions for Sendmail
================================

Two descriptions are provided, for use with Jim Crammond's UK-Sendmail-1.4
configuration package. One configuration is a direct replacement for
'hhcpm.m4' and the other is a version that invokes an authorisation process.

When setting up a machine description with UK-sendmail-1.4, type 'MAKE',
specify your machine and domain names as appropriate, and ask for the
'janet' mailer in addition to any others you may need. When MAKE is done,
put a copy of niftpm.m4 in the new configuration directory under the name
'hhcpm.m4'. You may wish to replace the copy of hhcpm.m4 in Mailers.a so
that new configurations will always get the NIFTP mailer rather than the
York one.

You may have trouble with addresses in the 'uk.ac' domain, as UK-sendmail
strips off this prefix for the hhcp mailer. A fix for that is contained
in chnMAKE.patch which should be applied to MAKE in the chn directory.

Files supplied: auth-niftpm.m4 niftpm.m4 chnMAKE.patch

NB: If you roll it yourself, it is ESSENTIAL that when cpf is exec'd by
    ni_send, that the uid is root or the value of MAILUSER in niftptailor.
    As cpf should NOT be setuid (as this would allow ANYONE to pretend to be
    the mailer), the S flag should be set in the sendmail.cf so that ni_send
    and hence cpf, runs as root.
