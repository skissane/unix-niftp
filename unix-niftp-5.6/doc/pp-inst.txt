_I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n

This short note is intended to be  a  stop-gap  that  covers
what  you  need  to know to install _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P for operation
with PP. It is not intended to be a tutorial on  _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P,
partly  because  I  don't  know  enough and partly because I
don't have time.

_C_o_m_p_i_l_a_t_i_o_n

Currently, both PP and _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P think they are  in  charge
of  compilation, therefore there is a slight bootstrap prob-
lem. The best method currently therefore is the following.

1.   Compile PP without the greybook channel

2.   Comple _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P

3.   Compile PP with the greybook channel.

To configure and compile, _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P, you basically run _C_o_n_-
_f_i_g_u_r_e  and  answer  the  questions  it  asks. Make sure you
request use of PP in the  unspooled  mode.  Other  questions
such  as  the  place  for binaries etc are up to you. if you
don;t understand  the  question  COnfigure  is  asking,  hit
return and it will normally "do the right thing".

     % sh Configure


Once the configuration process is over, type _m_a_k_e and wait.

     % make

There should be no problems at this stage.

After this completes, you should next type "_m_a_k_e _f_u_l_l_i_n_s_t_a_l_l

which  should  install  everything  in the correct place. It
will also ask you for a master password. This is  only  used
for  ftp  transfers, and you can type anything you like here
if you are going to  using _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P for PP mail only. Oth-
erwise you should choose a good password, and forget it!

     % make fullinstall

The next step is to configure the run  time  support  system
and  database that _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P needs.  This consists of first
creating a tailor file (usually stored in  /etc/niftptailor)
and secondly building a dbm database of hosts.

_T_a_i_l_o_r_i_n_g _t_h_e _s_y_s_t_e_m.

A sample tailor file can be found in  Appendix  A.  However,
the necessary lines you will need are the following.

     QUEUE PP level=7,prog=psun

This line defines the PP queue. The name  "PP"  is  what  PP
will  use as its queue name. The level is for logging in the
niftp logs. Suitable levels vary from "1", minimal  logging,
to  "-1"  -  all  logging.  The prog bit is superfluous, but
doesn't hurt.

     NET janet queue=qj,address="000021001029/%E%X%D/%T"

This line identifies the network "janet" for outgoing calls.
When  the  PP greybook channel makes a call, it consults the
info field of the channel to determine the network. This  is
used to work out what address to use in outgoing calls.  The
queue key sets the queue, but I don;t know why.  The address
key/value  sets  up the calling and called addresses respec-
tively. These are constructed in a printf like  manner  with
literal characters copied and %'s marking subsitutions.  The
following substitutions are legal.

     %E  Our YBTS string (e.g. FTP, FTP.MAIL)
     %X  Separator between calling and called address
     %D  Destintaion DTE number
     %T  Destination YBTS string (e.g. FTP, FTP.MAIL)
     %O  The variable set by OURNAME.
     %P  pink book context

So, the above string with DTE of  00000511160005  and  a  YB
string of UCL-CS.FTP.MAIL we would generate

     calling address:  000021001029/FTP.MAIL
     called address:   00000511160005/UCL-CS.FTP.MAIL

     LISTEN pj address="FTP.MAIL",level=7,prog=qsun,channel=janet

This line registers a listener for incoming mail. It matches
on  the  address "FTP.MAIL", has a logging level of "7", and
claims to be from the janet network. This  implies  that  it
will be channel "gb-janet" when passing on to PP.

This is all that is essential for PP to make  use  of  _U_N_I_X-
_N_I_F_T_P.   However,  there are a number of useful variable you
can set that help if you wish to move things around (such as
log  directories  for  example). Some of the more useful are
given in Appendix B.

_B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g _t_h_e _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e.

The easiest way of building the database is with  the  c-nrs
program.  In  fact,  this  is  so easy that I'm not going to
describe other methods!  So, first get  hold  of  the  c-nrs
package and build that. Once this is done, you can then gen-
erate the _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P database by the following commands.

     nrs dbm1.cf > dbm1
     nrs dbm1.cf 'output reverse' >> dbm1
     dbencode < dbm1

What could be simpler!

_T_e_s_t_i_n_g _t_h_e _s_y_s_t_e_m _f_o_r _o_u_t_g_o_i_n_g _m_e_s_s_a_g_e.

With all this done, the system should now work for  outgoing
calls.   Make  sure  you  have done a "make install" in PP's
Chans/grey directory to get the greybook channel  installed.
Now mail a message to a host that makes use of the grey book
channel and see if it works. Hopefully  if  it  doesn't  you
will  get  a  useful diagnostic. This will appear usually in
either the PP log directory in a file such as  "greyout"  or
in the _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P log directory in "log.pPP".

_S_e_t_t_i_n_g _u_p _t_h_e _i_n_c_o_m_i_n_g _s_y_s_t_e_m.

This is best done by running a daemon such  as  ybtsd.  This
daemon  is started at boot time usually and listens for Yel-
low Book transport calls. When one is received, it looks  at
the  Yellow Book address and determines what program to call
to process this. This matching up is done through  the  file
ybts-auth.  This is usually in an "etc" directory. It can be
/etc/ybts-auth,         /usr/local/etc/ybts-auth          or
/etc/sunlink/cbs/ybts-auth.

To configure PP to accept incoming calls you need to do  the
following.   In the PP chans directory, make a symbolic link
from greyin to the name of the LISTEN name in the _U_N_I_X-_N_I_F_T_P
file. This is "pj" in the above example.




                     February 20, 1991





                           - 4 -


     % ln -s greyin pj

Now arrange for the ybtsd to invoke this process for  incom-
ing FTP.MAIL requests. A suitable line in the ybts-auth file
might be

     /usr/pp/chans/pj:ftp.mail:*

The first part being the pathname of the symbolic  link  you
just  created,  the second being the YBTS address (ftp.mail)
and the third field saying any calling address is allowed to
invoke this.

This should now be set up to  allow  incoming  and  outgoing
mail.

          name,  the software will try adding these names to
          what it is looking for  should  the  first  lookup
          fail.

               DOMAIN "uk.ac", "uk.co"


LOGDIR    The directory in which the log files  are  created
          and written.

               LOGDIR /usr/spool/niftp/logs
