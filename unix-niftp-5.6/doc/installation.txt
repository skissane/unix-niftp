                          _A_B_S_T_R_A_C_T

          This document details the installation  steps
     that   are   part   of  the  installation  of  the
     _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p system for  blue  and  grey  book  file
     transfer.   This package is extremely configurable
     and is designed to work on  all  X.25  implementa-
     tions.



_1.  _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n

This document comes in several parts. It is  probably  worth
reading the document through once before attempting to build
and install _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.  The  process  for  installation  is
basically the following:

o+    Unpacking the distribution. This is dependant obviously
     on how you received the distribution.

o+    Configuring the compile time options  (if  you  have  a
     source distribution). This process is aided by the Con-
     figure script.

o+    Installation of the software

                           - 2 -


o+    Setting up the run time tailoring options.

o+    Starting up the system.

Obviously some of these steps are more involved than  others
- but the system is designed to be easy to install.

_1._1.  _R_e_p_o_r_t_i_n_g _P_r_o_b_l_e_m_s

The maintainers of this package are interested  in  feedback
to  do with the software and installation.  If you find par-
ticular difficulty or feel there is something missing either
from  the  system  or  the  documentation  please report it.
There is a distribution list of people involved in maintain-
ing and running the _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p package, if you would like to
be added send a message to the address:

        unix-niftp-request@uk.ac.nott.cs

However, for reporting bugs, discussing problems and so  on,
the appropriate address is

        unix-niftp@uk.ac.nott.cs

Please include with your comments the following information.

1.   The version of _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p that you are running.

2.   The machine type you are running it on and the  version
     of the operating system.

3.   What sort of X.25 interface you  are  running  and  the
     version of that if appropriate.

Well, with the commercial out of the way,  we  will  take  a
look at the configuration of the system.

_2.  _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_s

You will need some disk space, at least one  network  inter-
face, and a few days to understand and install _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.

_2._1.  _D_i_s_k _s_p_a_c_e

The source distribution takes around  1.1 MB  in  tar  form.
When unpacked and compiled it takes around 6.5 MB (the exact
figure depends on the distribution and the number of network
interfaces you configure).

The installation puts files in several places:

The figure for spool area includes a copy of the  NRS  data-
base,  but  as  the  dbm(3) files are built in this area and
moved into place you will need at  least  3MB  of  headroom.
Mail  files are also held here awaiting transmission or pro-
cessing, so an overall 10 MB might be a better estimate  for
spool space.

The NRS (Name Registration Scheme) database is almost essen-
tial  if  you  are  in the UK academic community. It is less
useful or irrelevant in other cases.  If  using  NRS,  allow
space  for  the raw (DERFIL) form and for the nrs processing
software: more about this later.

_2._2.  _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_s

_U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p will work with a wide  range  of  network  inter-
faces.  It  is  possible  to configure several interfaces at
once. The list of available interfaces is continuously grow-
ing:  contact  the  mailing list for the latest information.
Most of the interfaces are based on X25, but the  code  will
work  with  any reasonable full-duplex network.  The current
list of interfaces follows.

_2._2._1.  _S_u_n

SunLink-X25 (Sun part number 700-1190-04,  manual  800-1333-
04)  allows  either  serial port on a Sun processor board to
act as an X25 synchronous interface.  It can  also  be  used
with the SunLink Communication Processor board.  Performance
is quite adequate at 9600  Baud  with  the  on-board  serial
port;  this  could  probably be pushed to 19200 Baud without
serious problems.

_2._2._2.  _X_2_5_B

This allows any machine with access to TCP/IP services on  a
network to make calls out on X25 through a `bridge' machine.
The bridge will run on any machine  which  runs  the  "spad"
program (contact pb@uk.ac.cam.cl for details).

_2._2._3.  _U_B_C

The University of British Columbia have produced  a  socket-
based  implementation  of X25 as part of their EAN mail sys-
tem.  This is known to run on DEC VAX using a  DMF-32  comms
board  and  SUNs  using  the  zss lines. It may run on other

4.2Bsd-like systems.  Contact John Demco <demco@ean.ubc.cdn>
for  information  on  licensing.   Contact  William Armitage
<wja@cs.nott.ac.uk> for UK implementation info.  The distri-
bution  is  in the form of a set of sources to implement the
'CCITT' network in the kernel.

_2._2._4.  _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t

If your machine supports Berkeley sockets, you already  have
this network interface. It can be used over ethernet or any-
thing else that your IP network runs on.
If you have TCP connectivity, why not use the  standard  TCP
protocols ?

_2._2._5.  _I_P_C_S

This is a UCL special -- you probably do not want it.

_2._2._6.  _D_e_x_p_a_n_d

Dexpand is made by Camtec Electronics, and  is  an  X25  (or
Cambridge  Ring)  interface  for  DEC VAX machines. You will
need the Z1 software supplied by the manufacturers.
If you have an option, do not use this interface.

_2._2._7.  _Y_o_r_k

_U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p can use the YorkBox  Front  End  Processor,  thus
replacing  a  large  part  of the original York code. It can
also use any network interface which has the same procedural
interface  as  the YorkBox. This includes many manufacturers
X25 offerings.

To use the York interface, you will need the netio interface
library.

There are a number of ways in which you may receive the dis-
tribution.   These are generally either by tape, NIFTP or as
several mail messages.  Essentially though, they  are  basi-
cally  all  the  same  in  that you should end up with a tar
image to extract. Decide which of the methods  listed  below
is  the  one  that  reflects  your  situation and follow the
instructions.
Each way will eventally leave you with a tar file.  Create a
directory  for the image to reside in - this can be anywhere
in  the  file  system,  but  is   usually   somewhere   like



                      November 7, 1990





                           - 5 -


/usr/src/unix-niftp or /usr/src/local/unix-niftp.

        mkdir /usr/src/local/unix-niftp
        cd /usr/src/local/unix-niftp


_3._1.  _T_a_r _T_a_p_e

To unpack a tar image sent on a tape, read in the  tape  the
directory with the appropriate tar command.

        tar xv

You should now have the distribution unpacked and  ready  to
compile.

_3._2.  _N_I_F_T_P

If you have received the tar image via NIFTP you  will  most
likely  find that it has been compressed to reduce space and
transmission overhead  with  the  _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s(1)  program.  The
compress  program  is widely available and is distributed as
standard with most  versions  of  UNIX|-  now.   The  version
currently in use is version 4.0, if you don't have this ver-
sion you should get it.

Take the ftp file and uncompress it if necessary,  and  then
extract  the  contents.  This  can be done as one operation,
which is useful if disk space is tight.

        uncompress < unix.niftp.tar.Z | tar xvf -

This process should contain no errors. If it does,  then  it
is  either  the  case  that  you have a corrupt distribution
(this happens frequently when copying binary files using old
niftp  code)  or  you don't have permissions to write in the
directory you have created!

_3._3.  _M_a_i_l _D_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n

This is basically the same as the NIFTP version, so only the
changes  are noted here.  The distribution is almost certain
to be compressed and then fed  through  a  binary  to  ascii
translation  program.  The  two  most  like translations are
uuencode/uudecode and atob/btoa. The  distribution  will  be
also  usually  be  in separate messages, you must first edit
these together remvoing extraneous headers and footers. Make
sure you put them together in the right order too!  Once you
have done all this you should be left with one file. You now
need  to convert it to the binary form. This is most usually
uudecode but try atob if you have it and uudecode fails.

        uudecode < file
        atob < file > unix-niftp.tar.Z

From this stage on it is the same as the NIFTP case.







_4.  _C_o_m_p_i_l_e _t_i_m_e _t_a_i_l_o_r_i_n_g

This process should be fairly painless. It consists of  run-
ning the script _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script and answering the questions
it asks. The configure script attempts to discover  as  much
as it can for itself, but will in some cases ask for confir-
mation. In other cases it will ask  direct  questions  about
where to put binaries and so on.

Selecting options at compilation may not  be  easy,  if  you
have installed any PD software you will be used to questions
about compiler options and so on - but  the  questions  that
you may find hard are the ones about network options.  There
is a simple rule here, if you have not heard of it  -  don't
select  it.   You may cause compilation to fail when it does
not find the code.

If you are using sendmail, you  probably  want  the  compile
option

        -DMAILOWNSMAIL

which causes all qmail in the niftp queues to  be  owned  by
the mail user, rather than the sender of the mail.

When it has finished, Configure will  update  several  files
with its results and you are then ready to compile. However,
it is worth checking certain files to see if the values look
reasonable.  A  list  of the current defines and is given in
Appendix 1.

Now, to compile, simply type make and watch the  files  fly.
If  it  throws  up  errors, you may have specified something
wrong in the Configure or else you may have a weird system.

This should be achieved the first time by the command:

        make fullinstall

which does a "make dirs"  to  create  the  necessary  direc-
tories,  "make install" to install the files, and "make key-
file" to generate the secret key  for  password  encryption.
On subsequent installations, only the "make install" need be
run.

Note that you will most likely need to be the super-user  to
complete  this  step as it copies the software to the normal
system directories.  It is probably worth running make  with
the  `-n'  flag at this point just to be sure it isn't going
to do something unexpected.

Some assistance in checking and setting the modes  of  files
may  be  achied  by  invoking  make with the "showmodes" and
"setmodes" keys.  See "make help" for the full set  of  meta
keys for make.

Run time configuration allows the  administrator  to  change
the  behaviour  of  the system once compiled. The _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p
package has the vast majority  of  the  important  variables
tailorable in this way. This means that a change in the sys-
tem usually does not require a recompilation.

To begin with it is worth looking at some  of  the  standard
run  time  tailoring  files  supplied with the distribution.
These are in the directory samples/.

The best way to construct a tailor file is to  take  one  of
these  that  closely  resembles  your  system and modify the
things you need to.  A full list of the possible  option  is
listed  below,  together with some idea of what they do, and
how important they are.  First a quick note about the syntax
of the file.

Comments are allowed in the file, and start with a hash  (#)
and  terminate  at  the  end  of  the  line. Blank lines are
ignored and may be inserted to aid readability.  Most  items
occur in the form `Key value' or `Key List-of-values'.

This area is divided into two. There are  a  few  once  only
things  that  have to be done to allow the system to be run,
and some things that must be done each time a new version is
installed.

_7._1.  _O_n_c_e _o_n_l_y _a_c_t_i_o_n_s

The once only actions are as follows.   Normally,  you  will
want  the  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p  system to start running automatically
when your system reboots. To achieve this it is necessary to
add the following lines to your /etc/rc.local file.

        if [ -f /pathname/ftpspool ]; then
                /pathname/ftpspool logfile & (echo -n ' ftpspool') >/dev/console
        fi

You will need to supply the correct pathname depending  upon
where  you  installed  ftpspool.  Also check that you have a
dbm database.

The _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p package relies  fairly  heavily  on  the  NRS
database.  This needs to be converted into a _d_b_m(3) database
before it is usable. This is best done in the following way.
If the NRS tables are to be used, the bulk of the  dbm  file
is generated using the dbencode command.  Use c-nrs (contact
pb@uk.ac.cam.cl for details) to generate this.
In any case, it will be necessary to add some entries not in
the  NRS.  If dbencode is not use, just "touch" the .pag and
.dir files.  Having generated a  suitable  UAIEF  file  (see
samples/), dbpatch will make the necessary changes, e.g.

        nrs dbm1.cf
        dbencode < dbm
        dbpatch < UAIEF

Mail is support over the blue book transfer system  as  grey
book  mail.  An interface to some of the more common mailers
is provided with _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.  The interface works best  with
a  smart  mailer, or which the two most popular are probably
MMDF2 and Sendmail. The  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p  has  support  for  both
these and some more primitive mailers. If you run some other
mailer, you may need to change some  things  in  the  source
code.

If you use Sendmail as your mail handler, you must say so in
the Configuration phase of _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p. Most of the work will
then be done for you automatically.  When  running  Sendmail
it  is  normal  for mail to be owned and handled by the user
_r_o_o_t.

Sendmail will be used for forwarding mail received from  the
network,  and  also  for  notifying  users if something goes
wrong with a file-transfer request.   The  way  sendmail  is
invoked  and  the  parameters  passed  can  be configured in
/etc/niftptailor, using the MAILPROG and MAILFMT lines.  The
`mail  user'  can  also  be  specified.   These items should
default to appropriate values, but you may wish  to  specify
them anyway:

        MAILUSER        root
        MAILPROG        /usr/lib/sendmail
        MAILFMT sendmail, "%s -t", "%s -ba -oiY -oMs%s", 7

The real work comes when you  start  to  configure  Sendmail
itself!   If  you  are  thinking  of  sitting down to edit a

to info-server@uk.ac.ukc with the following contents:

If you have not got access to mail  yet  (which  is  likely,
since  this  document is telling you how to set it up!), you
will have to get the package by some other means.

Even if you are not installing _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p  in  the  UK,  the
configuration package is worth considering as it takes a lot
of the hassle out of setting up Sendmail. The rest  of  this
section assumes that you will use UK-sendmail-1.4a.

_9._2._2._2.  _C_h_o_o_s_i_n_g _a _d_o_m_a_i_n _n_a_m_e _f_o_r _m_a_i_l

The first thing to do is to choose  a  name  for  your  mail
`domain'.   This  must  follow certain rules: in particular,
you will almost certainly be  part  of  some  larger  domain
which  already  has  a name.  UK academic organisations will
have names starting `uk.ac.' (note that the  largest  domain
is  given  first  here, which is the reverse of normal prac-
tise.  Only the UK suffers from this, but it is relevant  to
_U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p,  being  a  package of UK origin).  UK commercial
organisations have names starting `uk.co.'.  Similar  domain
names  exist  in other countries.  A new university at Tring
in the UK might choose the name `uk.ac.tring'.  The UK's NRS
allows each organisation to have _t_w_o names: one long and one
short. The short name must fit  within  18  characters,  but
there  is no (specified) limit on long names. If at all pos-
sible, you should choose a _s_i_n_g_l_e name, and keep  it  short.
Where  your domain name is used by UK-sendmail, it will usu-
ally be the short form.

One final word on choosing names: do not name your  machines
by their CPU type. One day you might replace that VAX with a
Cray running Berkeley 4.7; you would not want  to  keep  the
same mail address on _t_h_a_t!
Also avoid use of a final component which  might  be  a  top
level  domain.   Most  new top level domains will be the two
letter ISO values.

If part of your organisation already has an electronic  mail
address you should discuss domain names with them and try to

present a consistent view to `the world  outside'.  This  is
made  quite  easy by UK-sendmail's `Multihost configuration'
option.

_9._2._2._3.  _M_a_k_i_n_g _t_h_e _f_i_r_s_t _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n

You will eventually need to make a  configuration  for  each
machine  in your organisation. Many of these will be identi-
cal, so for the moment let us consider only the machine that
will  be  running  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.  This  will  be the main mail
interface to the outside world. Let us suppose that it is  a
Sun, called Suleika.

In the UK-sendmail directory, type _M_A_K_E  (You  may  need  to
`chmod +x MAKE'  first).   The first question it will ask is
the hostname, which defaults to the name of the machine  you
are  using.  This name is used as the name of a subdirectory
in which the configuration will be constructed.

        Suleika% MAKE
        Sendmail initial configuration program  UK-1.4

        Enter hostname (Suleika):


On this occasion we accept the default by hitting  <return>.
When  making  configurations for other machines, the name of
the configuration can be given at this stage. (It  does  not
_h_a_v_e to be the name of a machine)

The next question asks for the sitename, which also defaults
to  the  machine name (obtained with _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e(_1) ).  At this
stage it is best to give the significant part of your domain
name,  so  Tring  University  would give the `tring' part of
`uk.ac.tring':

        Enter sitename (Suleika): tring


The sitename is used to identify data that is valid for  all
machines on that site.

The next question concerns `multihost sites'.  If  you  have
(or  expect  to  have) more than one mail-handling computer,
you should probably go for the multihost configuration:

        Is this a multihost site, where a collection of hosts
        are made to look like one site? (y|n) y


The machine (or configuration) name will become part of  the
`complete  domain  name'. Sendmail will use this name inter-
nally, but  the  machine-name  part  will  never  appear  in
addresses  sent  off-site.  Domain  names  are  specified in



                      November 7, 1990





                           - 14 -


`little-endian' order from now on:

        Complete domain name: Suleika.tring.ac.uk

        Host name = Suleika, Site name = tring,
        Domain name = tring.ac.uk (multihost site)
        confirm? (y|n)


If all that is OK, answer `y' and carry  on  to  select  the
mailers  that  you  will use. In this context, a mailer is a
means of sending a  message  to  a  remote  machine,  so  it
includes  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p,  uucp,  and  such  like. Assuming that
Tring has an Ethernet and wants to use  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p  for  all
off-campus mail, the dialogue would be something like this:

        ethernet? y
        Domain name on ethernet channel (tring.ac.uk):
        local uucp? n
        uucp? n
        janet? y
        Domain name on janet channel (in 822 format) (tring.ac.uk):
        bitnet? n
        csnet? n

                Are you using bsd4.3 or Sun 3.0 sendmail? (y|n) y

        Making directory Suleika...
        creating rules...
        creating mailers...
        creating Makefile...
        creating Suleika.mc...
        Initial configuration complete.

        You now have to make the tring.dom and Suleika.chn files.


The `janet' mailer will use _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p. JANET is the name of
the  UK  Joint  Academic  Network, but the mailer is equally
valid for any network handled by _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.   The  question
about  the  version  of Sendmail is there because later ver-
sions  feed  _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t  addresses  through  the   per-mailer
rulesets  as  well  as _h_e_a_d_e_r addresses. If you don't under-
stand that, _d_o_n'_t _p_a_n_i_c because it does not  really  matter.
Just answer the question, and if in doubt say yes!

The MAKE script has now finished, and has issued a  reminder
that  the  job is not yet finished.  At this point, it would
be a good idea to look in the  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p  distribution,  in
the  directory  _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l  and select a mailer description to
replace _h_h_c_p_m._m_4 in the newly-created directory. You  should
check  that  the  pathname of the mailer binary (ni_send) is
correct for your installation.

                           - 15 -


The next job is to make the domain files, so _c_d _d_o_m and read
the  README  file.   You  will  probably want to extract the
example `.dom' files and look at them:

        ar x Examples.a

You can probably ignore  (and  delete)  the  bitnet.dom  and
csnet.dom  files.  The  ukuucp.dom file may not be necessary
either. Look at the file ed.local.dom, and create  something
similar  for your own site.  This maps from machine names to
full domain names and from any  subdomains  to  full  domain
names,  so  Tring  (which  has only two machines at present)
would have a file _t_r_i_n_g._l_o_c_a_l._d_o_m looking like this:

        # tring.local.dom
        #
        # maps from machine names to full domain names

        Suleika         Suleika.tring.ac.uk
        Ceres           Ceres.tring.ac.uk


If the _t_r_i_n_g._a_c._u_k domain were to be split into  subdomains,
say  to allow three departments to manage their own mail, it
might look like this:

        # tring.local.dom
        #

        Suleika         Suleika.cs.tring.ac.uk
        Ceres           Ceres.cs.tring.ac.uk
        Juno            Juno.ee.tring.ac.uk
        Papagena        Papagena.ee.tring.ac.uk
        Astraea         Astraea.me.tring.ac.uk


That sort of trick is a little more  complicated:  refer  to
the  UK-sendmail  documentation  for  full  details. We will
stick with the simpler case in this document.

The _t_o_p._d_o_m file lists `top level domains' such  as  UK  and
NZ.  The list supplied with UK-sendmail is now rather out of
date, but will do for now.  At  a  later  stage  you  should
obtain  an  up-to-date  list,  perhaps  by mailing the info-
server at uk.ac.ukc (request:  uknet;  topic:  top-domains).
If  in  doubt  about  what  `relay  site' to specify for any
domain, the best default option is ukc. One line in the sup-
plied _t_o_p._d_o_m file _m_u_s_t be changed if you have more than one
host: The UK domain should be relayed by  whichever  machine
you are installing _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p on:

        #  it should match something here. The RHS is a domain which specifies
        #  where the message should be relayed for further routing.
        #

        com             ukc.ac.uk

        nz              ukc.ac.uk
        oz              ukc.ac.uk


The _u_k._d_o_m table can be left exactly as it comes  until  you
have  the  NRS  processor  going.  If  you are not in the UK
domain, there will probably  be  some  equivalent  table  to
replace _u_k._d_o_m.

The domain tables can now be merged using the MAKE script in
the _d_o_m directory:

        MAKE tring tring.local.dom top.dom uk.dom


The channel tables now have to be  made,  so  _c_d ../_c_h_n  and
look   at  the  README  file.   Extract  the  examples  with
_a_r _x _E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s._a and have a look  at  them.  Again,  you  can
delete the ones not required.  Edit the remaining ._c_h_n files
to suit your local environment. Here are examples for Tring:

        # ether.chn
        #
        # Ethernet channel table
        #  The domain name on the LHS is routed to the host on the RHS.
        #

        Ceres.tring.ac.uk       Ceres

        #
        #  The Local channel
        #    The domain names listed here are local to this host

        #       NRS names
        #       Include both long and short forms
        tring.ac.uk
        #       UUCP name (if required)
        # tring.uucp
        #
        #  As we are a multihost site, we must include the following host
        names
        #
        Suleika.tring.ac.uk
        Ceres.tring.ac.uk


The _j_a_n_e_t._c_h_n file can be left empty for now, and filled  in
by  the  NRS  processor.  One point worth noting: if you are
using X25 to connect one or more of  the  machines  in  your
domain,  you  will  need  to list them in _j_a_n_e_t._c_h_n to force
their mail into _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.  UK-sendmail has a default  rule
that  causes  all mail to subdomains of `UK' to be handed to
the `janet' mailer. If you are not in the `UK'  domain,  you
may  need  to  modify the rule or place a list of sites into
_j_a_n_e_t._c_h_n.

The _t_o_p._c_h_n file may be linked to ../dom/top.dom for simpli-
city.

You are now ready to merge the channel tables:

        MAKE Suleika local.chn ether.chn janet.chn top.chn


The hard work is now over; _c_d ../_S_u_l_e_i_k_a and type _m_a_k_e (That
is  the normal, lower-case, make!) Make will copy the domain
and channel tables and merge them with the  machine-specific
information set up in the first phase. You can then test the
configuration by typing:  /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l -_b_t -_C_S_u_l_e_i_k_a._c_f
You should test ruleset zero with a good selection of possi-
ble addresses (both correct ones and bad ones). Ensure  that
all correct addresses eventually produce a line specifying a
mailer and an address. Here are a couple of examples:











                      November 7, 1990





                           - 18 -



        /usr/lib/sendmail -bt -CSuleika.cf
        ADDRESS TEST MODE
        Enter <ruleset> <address>
        > 0 fred
        rewrite: ruleset  3   input: "fred"
        rewrite: ruleset  3 returns: "fred"
        rewrite: ruleset  0   input: "fred"
        rewrite: ruleset  0 returns: "^V" "local" "^X" "fred"
        > 0 bill@tring
        rewrite: ruleset  3   input: "bill" "@" "tring"
        rewrite: ruleset 11   input: "bill" "@" "tring"
        rewrite: ruleset 11 returns: "bill" "@" "tring" "." "ac" "." "uk"
        and so on........
        rewrite: ruleset 15 returns: "bill"
        rewrite: ruleset  0 returns: "^V" "local" "^X" "bill"


Any off-site addresses should end up using the `hhcp' mailer
(hhcp is the name of a mailer used by an old X25 NIFTP pack-
age) Addresses within your own domain should  end  up  using
the `local' mailer.

Once you are happy with the behaviour of the  configuration,
install  it  with:  _m_a_k_e _i_n_s_t_a_l_l  You  should  then find the
existing sendmail daemon and kill it before starting  a  new
daemon with:

        /usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q1h

or whatever command you find in your /etc/rc.local

The job is done! If you have other  machines  to  configure,
you  should  make  Sendmail  configurations for them at some
stage. These will probably be much the  same  as  the  first
one, but without the `janet' mailer if they are not going to
use _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.

_9._2._2._4.  _T_e_s_t_i_n_g _t_h_e _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n

The address-testing phase above should  catch  most  errors,
but  the only way to test the whole system is to send a mes-
sage. Start by mailing something to yourself without  speci-
fying any domain names:

        echo hello | mail fred


If that works, try your local domain name too:

        echo hello | mail fred@tring.ac.uk


None of that should have gone anywhere near  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p,  so



                      November 7, 1990





                           - 19 -


the  next thing is to try a bouncer. Pick some friendly site
with a reasonably smart mailer (e.g. a site running MMDF  or
Sendmail) and bounce a message off them:

        echo bounce bounce bounce | mail fred%tring.ac.uk@brunel.ac.uk


That request should put a mail message into  the  _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p
outgoing queue.  You can then use _f_t_p_q to track its progress
(e.g. ftpq -mald), and look in the _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p  logs  to  see
what  happened  to  the  message.   If  everything is set up
correctly and the remote site is alive, you should get  your
message  back  within  a  few  minutes.  If not, look in the
ftpspool log (the argument to ftpspool in /etc/rc.local) and
the log files in (e.g.) /usr/spool/niftp/logs.


_9._2._2._5.  _L_i_k_e_l_y _p_r_o_b_l_e_m_s

Illegal format JNT mail file.
     This is an error message that may be sent by  a  remote
     MMDF  site.  It means that the remote site cannot iden-
     tify you from your address.  The  solution  is  to  get
     your  X25  calling  address correctly registered in the
     NRS.

Unknown host uk.ac.xyzzy
     The host uk.ac.xyzzy is not in  the  database  used  by
     _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p.    Sendmail   will   pass  the  address  to
     _U_n_i_x-_N_i_f_t_p quite happily because it seems to be a valid
     UK address.

_9._2._2._6.  _D_i_s_g_u_s_t_i_n_g _H_A_C_K

If you are an academic site with a JANET  line  but  no  PSS
line  (or a commercial site with PSS but not JANET) you will
want some way of relaying mail into the `other' domain.  UKC
will  do  this  for  you,  as  will  a number of other well-
connected sites. The problem is  to  get  the  mail  to  UKC
without putting the name of every UK.CO site into _j_a_n_e_t._c_h_n.
The trick here is to depend on the `domain escalation'  that
is  built  into  ni_send.  Where  an  address  of  the  form
'uk.ac.xx.yy' is presented to ni_send and not found  in  the
database,  the  least-significant domain is stripped off and
the lookup is retried. Thus,  mail  for  an  unknown  domain
`uk.ac.xx.yy' would be sent to a known domain `uk.ac.xx' for
forwarding. (This assumes that the machine representing that
domain  is _c_a_p_a_b_l_e of forwarding! Not many non-Unix machines
can do it...). Taking this one stage further, if there  were
a known site `uk.co', it could relay all mail for subdomains
of `uk.co'. There is no such site, but since the  mailer  at
UKC  is quite tolerant it is possible to make a phantom site
_c_a_l_l_e_d `uk.co' but having UKC's _n_e_t_w_o_r_k  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.   This  is
done with a line in the UAIEF file:



                      November 7, 1990





                           - 20 -



        h:uk.co:uk.co:janet:4:000049200000:FTP.MAIL:::0:50:0:


For a commercial site on PSS wishing  to  have  all  `uk.ac'
mail relayed, the equivalent line would be:

        h:uk.ac:uk.ac:pss:4:234222715151:FTP.MAIL:::0:50:0:


See the section on setting up the database for more informa-
tion on UAIEF.

Note however, that this is contrary  to  the  GreyBook  spec
[[or is it the NRS]].
