                senders when finished

        Item can be a
        QUEUE
        LISTENER
        HOST

If an item is unique then there is no problem, otherwise you
can prefix it with "queue", "listen" or "host" to force to the
correct type.

All above can be used as arguments :-
        fpc "start qj" "stop janet" (quoting is significant)
or interactively

There is a of qualifier "all" which means what it says:-
        I.e. "stop listen all" stops all listeners
             "stop all" stops all queues.


ALso there is a command kill which can only be used as an
argument which shuts down the system.
