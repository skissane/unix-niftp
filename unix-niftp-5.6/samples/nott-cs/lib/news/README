These are samples of the news/unix-niftp interface at Nottingham.
Currently running 2.10.3 news or there abouts.

sendbatch is called by crontab at intervals with named systems as arguments.
This builds batches and invokes the *.cmd file which in turn calls on
$(LIBDIR)/newsin.

niftp calls $(LIBDIR)/newsout which moves the files into the path of rnewsd
which is started from rc.local.

To  send/receive news the niftp database must have news context entrys in
its database. nrsbuild reads these from UAIEF. They clobber the NRS derived
entrys for the host so you have to provide all the relevent contexts.
