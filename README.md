# unix-niftp

This is the `unix-niftp` package version 5.6.

Implements [Blue Book Network Independent File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloured_Book_protocols#Blue_Book),
which was formerly used for file transfer among universities in the UK in the 1980s thru early 1990s.

Sourced from http://cd.textfiles.com/internetinfo/networking/x25/core-niftp.tar.gz

Circa 1993

I didn't write any of this, I just dumped it here.
Written by Piete Brooks at University of Cambridge, inter alia

See also https://github.com/Wildboar-Software/pp which supports working with this (although I haven't tried it)
